This credit can be applied to any available fare on our website, and it does not expire. Additionally, I can waive the change fee, so you'll only need to pay the difference in fare if you'd like to use the travel credit for a different flight.

Please note that this offer is only available if you cancel your flight within the next [insert time frame, e.g., 24 hours]. If you wait longer, the ticket will become non-refundable, and we won't be able to offer any credits or refunds.
