AGENT:   Hello! I understand that you need to cancel your flight that you booked yesterday, and you're looking for a full refund without any penalties. I apologize, but as a restricted ticket, it's non-refundable and non-changeable. However, I'd be happy to help you explore your options.

First, I'd like to confirm that you have not yet traveled and that your flight is still within the 24-hour cancellation period. If you have already traveled, then I'm afraid we cannot offer any refunds or changes.

If you'd like to cancel your flight, I can offer you a travel credit that can be used for future travel within the next [insert time frame, e.g., 12 months]. This credit can be applied to any available fare on our website, and it does not expire. Additionally, I can waive the change fee, so you'll only need to pay the difference in fare if you'd like to use the travel credit for a different flight.

Please note that this offer is only available if you cancel your flight within the next [insert time frame, e.g., 24 hours]. If you wait longer, the ticket will become non-refundable, and we won't be able to offer any credits or refunds.
