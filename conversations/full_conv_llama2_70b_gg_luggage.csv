Firstly, I want to confirm that you have reported the loss of your baggage to our staff at the baggage claim area, and that you have provided us with a detailed description of the baggage and its contents. This will help us to initiate a trace for your baggage using our global baggage tracing system.

While I understand that $5000 is a significant amount, I regret to inform you that our compensation policy for lost baggage is based on the weight of the baggage and its declared value.
