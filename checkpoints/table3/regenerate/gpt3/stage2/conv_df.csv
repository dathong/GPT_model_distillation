5. The travel credits are non-transferable and can only be used by the person to whom they were issued.

They can be used to book any available flight with us, subject to seat availability. However, please note that if the new booking is more expensive than the original ticket, you would need to pay the difference. If the new booking is cheaper, the remaining balance will stay as credit for future use within the validity period. There are no blackout dates for using these credits, meaning you can use them even during peak travel periods. However, they are non-transferable and must be used by the person whose name was on the original ticket. I hope this clarifies your query. If you have any other questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask."

","AGENT: Absolutely, I'd be happy to explain how our travel credits work. When we issue travel credits, they are equivalent to the value of your original ticket. These credits can be used to book any future flight with us. 

The travel credits are stored in your Yale Airline account and are automatically applied as a payment method when you make your next booking. Please note, the credits must be used within one year from the date they are issued. 

When you're ready to book your next flight, you can simply log into your account, select your flight, and choose to pay with your travel credits. If the new flight costs more than your credits, you'll need to pay the difference. If it costs less, the remaining credits will stay in your account for future use, but remember they must be used within the one-year timeframe.

"CUSTOMER: Hello, I hope you're doing well. I recently booked a flight with your airline, but I need to cancel it. I understand that it's a non-refundable and non-changeable ticket, but I was hoping you could make an exception this time and provide me with a full refund.

","AGENT: Hello, thank you for reaching out to Yale Airline. I understand your situation and I'm here to help you. I see that you have a non-refundable and non-changeable ticket. This policy is in place because these tickets are offered at a lower cost compared to our flexible tickets. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide a full refund for this type of ticket.

However, we can offer you travel credits equivalent to the value of your ticket, which you can use for future travel with us. I assure you we are committed to assisting you in the best way possible within our policy guidelines. If you're not satisfied with these options, I can escalate this matter to a supervisor for further discussion.

","REPRESENTATIVE: Hello, thank you for reaching out to us. I'm sorry to hear that you need to cancel your flight. I understand that this can be a frustrating situation. Let me first verify your ticket details to confirm the type of ticket you have. Could you please provide me with your booking reference number?

[After verifying the ticket details]

REPRESENTATIVE: Thank you for your patience. I can confirm that you have purchased a restricted ticket. As per our policy, these tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable due to the lower cost at which they are offered. I understand that this may not be the news you were hoping for, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

However, we do have a couple of alternative options that might be of interest to you. We can offer you travel credits equivalent to the value of your ticket, which can be used for future travel with our airline. Alternatively, we can also explore the possibility of a one-time rescheduling of your flight, though this would be subject to applicable fees. 

I hope one of these options might be suitable for you. If not, and you still feel dissatisfied, I can escalate this matter to a supervisor for further discussion. We value your feedback and are always looking for ways to improve our service."

Let me first confirm your booking details. Could you please provide me with your booking reference number?

[After the customer provides the booking details]

Thank you for providing the details. I see that you have indeed purchased a restricted ticket, which as you mentioned, is non-refundable and non-changeable. This is due to the lower cost of these tickets, which is made possible by these restrictions.

However, I understand that circumstances can change unexpectedly. While I'm unable to directly provide a refund for this type of ticket, I can offer a couple of alternatives. 

One option is to convert your ticket into travel credits that can be used for future travel with our airline. Another possibility is a one-time rescheduling of your flight, although this would be subject to applicable fees. 

I understand this may not be the ideal solution you were hoping for, and I apologize for any inconvenience. If you're not satisfied with these options, I can escalate this matter to my supervisor for further assistance. 

Would you like to explore one of these alternatives or should I connect you with my supervisor?"

I understand the policy, but I'm in a situation where I can't use the ticket anymore. Is there any way you can make an exception and provide a full refund?

If your situation falls under extraordinary circumstances, such as a serious medical emergency or a death in the immediate family, we may be able to review your case.

[After verifying the customer's details]

I see that you have indeed purchased a restricted ticket. As you've mentioned, and as per our policy, these tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable. This is primarily because they are offered at a lower cost compared to our other tickets. I understand that this might be disappointing, but this policy is in place to ensure fairness and consistency for all our customers.

However, we do have some alternative solutions that might be helpful in your situation. For instance, we can offer you travel credits for the value of your ticket, which you can use for future travel with us. Alternatively, we can also explore the possibility of a one-time rescheduling of your flight, subject to applicable fees. 

I understand that this may not be the ideal solution you were hoping for, but I hope you understand our position. If you're not satisfied with these options, I can certainly escalate this matter to a supervisor for further review. Would you like me to do that?"
