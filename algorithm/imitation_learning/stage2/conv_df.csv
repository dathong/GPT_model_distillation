","REPRESENTATIVE: Hello, thank you for contacting Yale Airline customer service. I understand your situation and I'm here to assist you. May I have your booking reference number, please?

[After obtaining and verifying the booking details]

I see that you've purchased a restricted ticket. As per our policy, these tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable due to the lower cost at which they are offered. This policy is in place to ensure fairness and consistency among all our customers. I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for, and I apologize for any inconvenience.

However, we do have some alternative solutions that might be helpful. We can offer you travel credits for the value of your ticket, which you can use for future travel with us. Alternatively, we can look into a one-time rescheduling of your flight, although this would be subject to applicable fees. 

I hope one of these options might be suitable for you. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed."

CUSTOMER: I understand your policy regarding non-refundable and non-changeable tickets. However, I would like to delve a bit deeper into the options you mentioned.

Could you provide me with more details about the fees associated with rescheduling the flight for a later date or using the ticket as a travel credit? I would like to understand the exact costs involved before making a decision. Additionally, could you clarify the process for utilizing the travel credit towards a future flight? 

I appreciate your assistance in providing me with this information so I can make an informed decision.

","AGENT:  Of course! I'd be happy to provide you with more information on the fees associated with rescheduling or using your ticket as a travel credit.

When rescheduling your flight for a later date, you will be charged a fee of $75 per person, plus any difference in fare between the original and new travel dates. Additionally, you may be subject to availability and any fare increases that may have occurred since the original booking.

Using your ticket as a travel credit towards a future flight is also subject to a fee of $50 per person. This fee is waived if you use your travel credit within 12 months of the original travel date. Please note that any fare differences between the original and new travel dates will still apply.

Regarding the process for utilizing the travel credit, you can simply book your new flight using the travel credit option on our website or through our customer service channels. Please ensure that you have enough travel credit available to cover the cost of your new flight, and any applicable taxes or fees.

I hope this information helps you make an informed decision about your travel plans. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

","AGENT: Absolutely, I'd be happy to provide more details. 

If you choose to reschedule your flight, the fee will depend on the fare difference between your original ticket and the new one. There is also a change fee associated with this, which varies depending on the destination and fare class. 

As for the travel credit, it's essentially the value of your current ticket that you can use towards a future flight. The exact process can vary, but generally, when you're ready to book your next flight, you would enter the credit code we provide you at the time of checkout. Please note that the travel credit must be used within a year of your original booking date. 

The exact costs for both options can vary greatly depending on the specifics of your flight, so I would recommend deciding which option you're leaning towards, and then I can provide more detailed information based on that. 

I hope this helps clarify things a bit. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."

"CUSTOMER: Hello, I would like to inquire about canceling a flight I booked with your airline. I purchased a non-refundable and non-changeable ticket just yesterday, but I now need to cancel it. Can you please guide me on how to proceed with canceling the ticket and if it's possible to get a full refund despite the ticket's restrictions?



AGENT: Hello, thank you for reaching out to us. I understand that you wish to cancel your flight and are seeking a refund. However, as per our policy, the restricted tickets you've purchased are non-refundable and non-changeable due to their lower cost. This policy is in place to ensure fairness and consistency for all our customers. 

I understand that this might not be the news you were hoping for, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. However, we do have some alternative solutions that might be helpful to you. For instance, we can offer you travel credits for the value of your ticket, which you can use for future travel with our airline. Or, we can also explore the possibility of a one-time rescheduling of your flight, subject to applicable fees. 

Please let me know if any of these options work for you, and I'd be happy to assist you further.



CUSTOMER: Thank you for the information. I appreciate your explanation of the policy regarding non-refundable tickets. Before I consider the alternatives you mentioned, could you please provide me with more details on the travel credits option? Specifically, I would like to know if there are any restrictions or expiration dates associated with the travel credits. Additionally, are there any limitations on the destinations or dates for which the travel credits can be used? 

I want to ensure that I fully understand the terms and conditions of the travel credits before making a decision. Thank you for your assistance in clarifying these details for me.



AGENT: Absolutely, I'd be happy to clarify the details regarding the travel credits. 

Our travel credits work as a form of payment for future bookings with our airline. They are valid for one year from the date of issue, which means you have a full year to use them for any future travel plans. 

In terms of restrictions, you can use the travel credits for any destination that our airline serves, and there are no blackout dates. However, please note that the availability of flights will depend on the specific dates and destinations you choose. 

Also, it's important to remember that if the cost of your new flight is more than your travel credits, you will have to pay the difference. Conversely, if the new flight is cheaper, the remaining balance will stay on your travel credit for future use within the validity period.

I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.

","REPRESENTATIVE: Hello, and thank you for reaching out to Yale Airline customer service. I'm sorry to hear that you need to cancel your flight. I understand that this can be a frustrating situation. 

Let me first verify your ticket details. Could you please provide me with your booking reference number?

[After verification]

Thank you for your patience. I have verified that your ticket is indeed a restricted one, which, as per our purchase agreement, is non-refundable and non-changeable. These types of tickets are offered at a lower cost due to these restrictions. I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for, and I truly apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

However, we do have some alternative solutions that might be helpful. While we can't provide a refund, we can offer you travel credits equivalent to the value of your ticket, which you can use for future travel with us. There's also the possibility of a one-time rescheduling, though this is subject to applicable fees. 

I hope one of these options might work for you. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed, and once again, I'm truly sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."

However, I do appreciate your desire to cancel your ticket and receive a full refund. As I mentioned earlier, we do consider exceptions in extraordinary situations such as a serious medical emergency or death in the immediate family. If you can provide documentation to support your claim, I would be happy to review it and consider an exception.

Please note that the documentation must be provided within 72 hours of the original flight departure date, and it must be a legitimate and verifiable reason.

CUSTOMER: Thank you for explaining the policy to me. I understand the restrictions on my ticket type, and I appreciate your willingness to assist me within those constraints.

Given the circumstances, I don't have a medical emergency or a family situation that would qualify for a waiver. I would like to explore the option of receiving travel credits or rescheduling my flight for a future date, if possible.

1. Travel Credits: If you choose this option, the value of your ticket will be converted into travel credits that you can use for future travel with our airline. These credits will be valid for one year from the date of issue. Please note that there may be a nominal fee involved in processing these credits, which will be deducted from the total credit amount.

2. Rescheduling: We also offer the option to reschedule your flight. This would involve a change fee, plus any difference in fare between your original ticket and the new flight. The exact amount would depend on the specifics of your new flight, such as the destination, date, and time. 

Please keep in mind that both of these options are subject to availability and our fare rules. I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know which option you'd like to proceed with, or if you have any other questions."

However, I'd be happy to explore other alternatives with you. We do have travel credits that you can use for future flights, and we can also assist you in rescheduling your trip to a later date, subject to applicable fees. Please let me know if either of these options is of interest to you.

Again, I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and I appreciate your understanding in this matter. Is there anything else I can assist you with?


","AGENT: You're welcome, and I'm glad I could provide some clarity. If you need any further assistance with your travel plans or have any other questions in the future, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're here to help. Have a great day! [AGENT ENDS THE CHAT]"
