CUSTOMER: Thank you for clarifying the exceptions to the policy. I understand the importance of having such guidelines in place. In this case, my situation does not fall under the extraordinary circumstances you mentioned.

Considering the options you provided, I would like to explore the possibility of receiving travel credits for the value of the ticket. Could you please provide more details on how the travel credits work and any restrictions associated with them? I want to make an informed decision before proceeding. Thank you for your assistance.

"," AGENT: Of course, I'd be happy to provide more information on our travel credit option. Travel credits are a great way to use the value of your ticket towards a future flight with us. The travel credit will be issued in the form of a voucher, which can be used towards a new flight booking within one year from the original flight's departure date. The voucher can be applied to the base fare of a new flight, and any additional fees such as taxes and charges will be the responsibility of the passenger. There are no blackout dates or restrictions on the use of the travel credit, so you can use it whenever you're ready to book your next flight. Please note that the travel credit will be valid for one year from the original flight's departure date, so you'll need to use it within that timeframe. If you have any questions or concerns about the travel credit, please let me know. Would you like to proceed with the travel credit option?","AGENT: Absolutely, I'd be happy to explain how our travel credits work. 

When we issue travel credits, they are equivalent to the value of your ticket. These credits can be used to book any future flight with us. They are valid for one year from the date of issue, giving you flexibility to plan your travel according to your convenience.

Please note that if the new flight you choose is more expensive than the original one, you would need to pay the difference. If it's cheaper, the remaining balance will stay on your credit and can be used for future travel until the credit expires.

Also, it's important to mention that these credits are non-transferable, meaning they can only be used by you and cannot be given to someone else.

I hope this clarifies how our travel credits work. If you have any other questions or if there's anything else you'd like to know, please feel free to ask.

"," AGENT: Of course, I'd be happy to provide you with more information on the fare rules and alternatives available.

At Yale Airline, we understand that plans can change, and we want to help you find a solution that works for you. However, as mentioned earlier, our restricted tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable due to their lower cost.

The fare rules for your ticket will determine the options available to you. Some tickets may offer travel credits or the possibility of a one-time rescheduling, subject to applicable fees. The terms and conditions of these alternatives will be outlined in your ticket details.

Regarding exceptions, our policy allows for waiving the non-refundable and non-changeable restrictions in extraordinary situations such as a serious medical emergency or death in the immediate family. In such cases, we may require appropriate documentation (e.g., medical certificate, death certificate) to consider a waiver of the policy.

Please provide me with your booking reference number so I can verify the details of your ticket and explore these options further.

Our fare rules for restricted tickets are designed to offer a lower-cost option for travelers who are certain about their travel plans. Because of the lower cost, these tickets come with certain restrictions, primarily that they are non-refundable and non-changeable. This means that once purchased, they cannot be cancelled for a refund or changed without incurring a fee.

However, we do understand that sometimes circumstances change unexpectedly, which is why we offer some alternatives. One option is to convert your ticket into travel credits, which you can use for future travel with our airline. The amount of the credit would be the value of your original ticket, minus any applicable fees.

Another option is a one-time rescheduling of your flight. This would also be subject to a change fee, and the new flight would need to be of equal or lesser value than your original ticket.

As for exceptions to the policy, these are typically only made in extraordinary circumstances, such as a serious medical emergency or death in the immediate family. In such cases, we would need appropriate documentation, such as a medical certificate or death certificate, to consider waiving the policy.

I hope this provides some clarity on our policies and the options available to you. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.

In this case, I would like to explore the option of travel credits or a one-time rescheduling of my flight. Could you please provide more details on how these options work and what the applicable fees would be? I want to make the best decision possible given the circumstances. Thank you for your assistance and understanding.

"," AGENT: Of course, I'd be happy to help. Travel credits are a great option for customers who need to reschedule their trip but can't cancel their ticket entirely. With a travel credit, you can use the value of your ticket towards a future flight within a year of the original travel date. The credit can be applied to the base fare of your new flight, and any additional fees such as taxes and charges will still apply. The fee for using a travel credit is $50, and you can use it towards a maximum of two flights within the year.

One-time rescheduling is another option we offer, subject to applicable fees. This option allows you to change your flight date or time, but you'll need to pay a fee of $75 per flight segment. Please note that this option is only available for tickets booked directly with the airline, and it's subject to availability.

Both options are a great way to ensure that you can still travel on your preferred date without incurring additional penalties. If you're interested in either of these options, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist you further.","AGENT: Absolutely, I'd be happy to provide more details on these options. 

1. Travel Credits: With this option, the value of your ticket will be converted into travel credits, which you can use for future travel with our airline. These credits will be valid for a year from the date of issue. Please note that there might be a small processing fee involved, which will be deducted from the total value of your ticket.

2. One-time Rescheduling: If you already have a new travel date in mind, we can reschedule your flight. However, please note that a rescheduling fee will apply. The exact amount depends on the destination and the time of rescheduling. If the new flight is more expensive than the original one, you will also need to pay the difference in fare.

I hope this information helps. Please let me know which option you'd like to proceed with, or if you have any more questions.

"CUSTOMER: Hello, I hope you're doing well. I recently booked a flight with your airline, but I'm afraid I need to cancel it. I tried to do it through the app and website, but I couldn't find a way to cancel. I realized that the ticket is non-changeable and non-refundable. Is there any way I could cancel it without penalty and get a full refund?



AGENT: Hello, I'm sorry to hear that you're unable to make your flight. I can certainly assist you with your request. However, as you've mentioned, you have purchased a restricted ticket, which, as per our policy, is non-refundable and non-changeable. These tickets are offered at a lower cost due to these restrictions.

I understand that this might be disappointing, but these conditions are part of the agreement when purchasing this type of ticket. It helps us to keep our costs low and offer competitive prices to all our customers. 

However, depending on the circumstances, there might be some alternatives we can explore. For instance, we could consider offering you travel credits for future use or the possibility of a one-time rescheduling, subject to applicable fees. Could you please provide me with your booking reference so I can verify your ticket details and explore the best possible options for you?

1. Travel Credits: We can convert the value of your ticket into travel credits, which you can use for future travel with us. These credits will be valid for a year from the date of issue.

2. One-time Rescheduling: You can reschedule your flight to a later date. However, please note that there might be a difference in fare, and you'll be responsible for any additional costs.

Please let me know which option suits you best, or if you have any other questions or concerns.

"CUSTOMER: Hi there! I need to cancel a flight I booked with your airline yesterday, but I just realized it's a non-refundable and non-changeable ticket. I really need to cancel it without any penalty and get a full refund. Can you help me with that?



AGENT: I'm sorry to hear that you need to cancel your flight. I understand that plans can change unexpectedly. However, as you've mentioned, you have purchased a restricted ticket which is non-refundable and non-changeable as per our policy. 

This policy allows us to offer these tickets at a lower cost, and it's important for us to apply it consistently to ensure fairness to all our customers. I hope you understand.

CUSTOMER: Oh, I see. I really appreciate you explaining the policy to me. I totally understand the need for consistency and fairness. However, I was really hoping to get a full refund this time. Is there any way we can make an exception in this case? I promise it's a one-time thing for me.



AGENT: I truly understand your situation and I wish I could help more. However, as per our policy, we are unable to make exceptions for the refund of restricted tickets unless there are extraordinary circumstances such as a serious medical emergency or a death in the immediate family.

"," AGENT: Of course, I'd be happy to provide you with more information on our travel credits and rescheduling options.

Travel Credits:
Travel credits are a great way to use the value of your non-refundable ticket for future travel. These credits can be applied to any Yale Airline flight within one year of the original booking date. The credits can be used to purchase a new ticket, and any remaining balance can be applied to future travel. Please note that travel credits are non-transferable and can only be used by the original booker.

Rescheduling:
If you're unable to travel on your original flight date, you can reschedule your flight to a later date, subject to availability. Please note that there may be a rescheduling fee, which varies depending on the fare rule of your ticket. The rescheduling fee can be found on our website or by contacting our customer service team.

In terms of applicable fees, here's a breakdown of what you can expect:

* Rescheduling fee: This fee varies depending on the fare rule of your ticket. Please refer to our website or contact our customer service team for more information.
* Travel credit fee: There is no fee for applying travel credits to a new ticket. However, any remaining balance on the travel credit must be used within one year of the original booking date.

I hope this information helps you make an informed decision on how to proceed. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.","AGENT: Absolutely, I'd be happy to provide more information on these alternatives.

1. Travel Credits: If you choose this option, the value of your ticket will be converted into travel credits, which you can use for future travel with our airline. These credits will be valid for one year from the date of issue. Please note that if the new flight you book in the future is more expensive than your original ticket, you will need to pay the difference. 

2. Rescheduling: If you already have a new travel date in mind, you can opt to reschedule your flight. The rescheduling fee varies depending on the destination and the fare class of your ticket. Once I have more details about your new travel plans, I can provide a more accurate estimate of the fee.

Please note that both options are subject to availability and fare differences. I hope this information helps. If you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to know, please feel free to ask.
